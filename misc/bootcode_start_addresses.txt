Start address of program needs to be modified per program:

6101  :  ??????? (for now N64CICC doesen't change the EP adress)
6102  :  nothing
6103  :  Add $100000 ($80000400 would be $80100400 instead)
6105  :  nothing
6106  :  Add $200000 ($80000400 would be $80200400 instead).

To disassembly existing bootcode:
n64-objdump -b binary -m mips -EB -D boot/6105
