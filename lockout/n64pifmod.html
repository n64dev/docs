        &quot;import mod&quot; is,basically,it's an<br>
        internal modification inside the n64 that lets you play
        import games<br>
        on your console without the need of an adaptor or
        somethin else.<br>
        i never found infos on the net about such a mod,dunno
        why,perhaps because<br>
        only europeans suffer from this problem,between japanese
        and<br>
        american carts,there is no lockout incompatiblity,just
        the tabs in the cart slot<br>
        that need to be cut away,so propably im the first to do
        this <br>
        tell me if im wrong on that one...<br>
        this mod is complete and runs ALL NTSC AND PAL
        CARTS(obviously ;) on a PAL- or NTSC-N64.<br>

        size="3" face="Arial Black"><strong>the mod works like
        this:<br>
        <br>
        basically you just cut out the security-chip [PIF(P)-NUS]
        out of a pal-n64 and connect most pins to the equivalent
        pins of the ntsc security-chip [PIF-NUS] of a
        ntsc-n64.the pins<br>
        that were not connected are seperated and soldered via 5
        two-way switches to the pcb.<br>
        now you can switch between pal and ntsc n64 settings and
        there are NO limitations,EVERY single cart will work ;)<br>
        be warned:<br>
        you should only do this mod if you are experienced with
        soldering and stuff!!<br>
        while doing this mod,you mess around with the pins of
        smd-chips,that will break if you bend<br>
        them more than 2 times.(if they do,you even need to open
        the chip itself and this is REALLY tricky,trust me
        &gt;:-[ ) <br>
        <br>
        ok,you should do it like this:<br>
        open both n64 (how to build a nintendo screwdriver is
        explained in the cheap mod guide).<br>
        now you have 2 choices:<br>
        take out the PIF-NUS of a pal n64(use a needle and a
        soldering iron to lift up the pins) and solder it
        directly onto the <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">ntsc-pif</B>,but i cant recommend this
        one,cause its very likely that you break a pin.<br>
        for me,the best choice was to desolder both,the ntsc and
        the pal PIF-NUS,solder both on seperate pcb ( you can buy
        readymade boards for all kinds of smd-chips in your fav
        electronic store) and run wires from these pcbs.that
        means you arent in danger of breaking any pins on the
        PIFs,cause these little babys are worth a whole n64,you
        know ;)</strong></font></p>

        face="Arial Black"><strong><img src="l33tmod.jpg" width="700"
         height="700"><br>
        once this is done,run wires from a pifs pins that are
        marked green on the pic to their equivalent pins on the
        other pif and the pcb(bad explanation,sorry ;)<br>
        for example you run a wire from PIF(P)-NUS pin 1 to pin 1
        of PIF-NUS and to pin 1 on the pcb,so all pin 1s are
        hooked up together.<br>
        run wires from the pins marked white to ground somewhere
        on the n64 board.<br>
        the other pins running from pif-nus and pif(P)-nus are
        connected to the pcb via a relais and a 2 way switch(or a
        jk flip flop + button if ur cool dude ;)</strong></font></p>
