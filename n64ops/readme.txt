   This is a collection of programming information for the Nintendo 64
   that i've gathered. It is currently splitted into these parts:

   n64ops#a.txt - Brief list of R4300i opcodes
   n64ops#b.txt - Detailed list of R4300i opcodes
   n64ops#c.txt - R4300i opcode matrix

   n64ops#d.txt - Brief list of RSP opcodes
   n64ops#e.txt - Detailed list of RSP opcodes
   n64ops#f.txt - RSP opcode matrix

   n64ops#g.txt - ROM header information
   n64ops#h.txt - Nintendo 64 memory map

   Contributed by other people:
   rcp.txt      - RCP information, opcodes etc.
   sound.txt    - How to play sound on the N64.
   controll.txt - How to access the N64 controller.

   If you find any errors in the text, or miss anything, please
   inform me about that, either by email <anarko@flashback.net>
   or ICQ #: 3299208.

                 |   in #b, now much more complete.
                 | * Removed examples in #b, as they only
                 |   took up place.
                 | * Corrected LOTS of errors in #b, there should
                 |   only be minor errors like spelling left now.
