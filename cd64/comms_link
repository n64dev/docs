74LS373 are actually 74LS374.

When AEN is low and a correct address is decoded (0x3[0-3][02])
for status port, then ff (busy) or fe (idle) is driven on data lines, depending
if PCX is high or low.  For data port, if AEN low and address decoded, then
when IOR driven low, latched data is placed on data lines; when IOW driven low,
data lines are latched.

When DATAWR is asserted from target, (STATUS_REG D0) line is lowered.
This lowers busy flag (... and asserts IRQ.  How is IRQ cleared?)

capacitors? resistors?
